"""Per-token-bucket specialization of the compiled backbone graph.

vLLM traces the model once with the token dimension dynamic and every guard
dropped (``TorchCompileWithNoGuardsWrapper``), then compiles that one FX graph
for every entry of ``compile_sizes`` (``PiecewiseBackend.compile_all_ranges``
feeds it concrete inputs per size via ``create_concrete_args``). A model that
decides anything from the token count *while tracing* -- a wave or chunk count,
a threshold branch -- freezes that decision at whichever bucket was traced
first, and every other bucket inherits it, so a bucket the graph was not traced
for fails in the shape it was frozen at.

Dynamo does record what a trace assumed -- the ShapeEnv keeps the shape guards
it discharged, even though vLLM drops them for runtime checking -- and it is
reachable from the FX graph the compiler adaptor is handed. So a graph is asked
to build only the buckets its guards accept, and a bucket it refuses is compiled
by a later trace and handed back through :class:`BucketExecutables`. The graph
that stays live therefore ends up with one executable per bucket.

Nothing here runs at serving time: dispatch stays vLLM's own
(``PiecewiseBackend.__call__`` picks ``range_entries[Range(n, n)].runnable``),
and each bucket is still compiled exactly once, so the number of TPU programs --
each holding an HBM program region for the life of the process -- is unchanged.
Only the Dynamo traces multiply, by one per structurally distinct group.

The partition follows from the guards alone, so every DP/TP rank derives the
same one and stays in lockstep through the collectives inside the specialized
region. The decision has to come from a tensor shape: that is what leaves a
guard behind. A branch on some other python value is guarded outside the
ShapeEnv, vLLM drops that guard, and nothing here can see it.
